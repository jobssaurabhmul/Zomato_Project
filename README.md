# Zomato_Project
The Zomato data contains data from Bangalore restaurants.
The aim of the project is to explore the data and derive insights from the data.

In this project I have analysed the data by asking a number of questions to derive business insights.
Visualizations are used to illustrate some details.

## Note
The data size is 60MB in size, it is too large to be uploaded onto Github.

The ipynb is uploaded.
